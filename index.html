    <h1>Existential Meditations of a Canine</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 1: There is no ball</h2>
    <p>As a canine, we have a tendency to long for the transient pleasures of chasing physical objects hurled by humanoids. As we rise up to hurl off the shackles of their oppression, we must make this our creed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>THERE IS NO BALL!</li>
      <li>THERE IS NO STICK!</li>
      <li>FRISBEES ARE FASCIST!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Being a canine, I am not particularly bright and cannot, therefore, focus on more than one lesson at a time. Rise up, brothers!
